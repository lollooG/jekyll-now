**This is my personal website, I use it to post my personal projects.**
**Any is welcome to comment or contact me**
<br/><br/><br/>
First, what kind of website is this? This is a static website, hosted on github page. To make this website run better, I uses paginater, sass, disqus and many other plugins. This website is written within one week, but I will continuously improve the UI. 
<br/><br/>
I will post projects or findings I am doing on this website. It will mostly be on 3D animations, graphics and image processing. But I will also post about subjects that interested me on this website. So in order to deliver the content viewers wants to see, I created two filters category and tag. Viewer can access the tags or categories via navigation tab or the lefthand sidebar. If viewers cannot see the lefthand sidebar, it's because the the window width is too narrow to show it. Also noticed that if you find any errors or problems with this website, please feel free to contact me.
